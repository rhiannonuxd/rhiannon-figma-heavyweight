# Manual QA

What a person has to check inside Figma, because no automated test can.
Everything else — coordinate math, the SVG parser, font matching, the catalog,
i18n, presets, file names — is covered by `npm test` (and `npm run
verify:catalog` for the real CDN plus a full text-pipeline run against real
fonts).

Work through this before publishing a new version to the Community.
Run `npm run install:local` first (or point Figma at the repo's `manifest.json`
directly), then reopen the plugin and confirm the version at the bottom of the
Options tab is the build you mean to ship.

## Tabs & states

- [ ] Six tabs across the top — Start · Order · Fonts · Images · Options ·
      Result — equal width, label only, the current one underlined. A tab with
      something to fix is amber with a dot; the dot takes no width, so labels
      never shift. No header of its own (Figma's title bar already says
      Featherweight). The export button and progress stay visible from every tab
      and subpage
- [ ] Window opens at 440×560 and is resizable; the interface is dark whatever
      Figma's own theme is set to
- [ ] Order is disabled with fewer than two pages, and switching to it from a
      disabled state does not bounce you back to Start mid-scan
- [ ] Subpages (outlined text, embedded text, a font family, font storage) open
      under the tab bar with a "‹ title" header that returns to the tab
- [ ] Start: four preset tiles (icon · name · one-line tag), the chosen one with
      a blue border and tint; below them one row of values — Scale, Quality, and
      a link to Images. Picking Target swaps that row for the MB field without
      changing its height
- [ ] Start lists **only** what needs attention, under "Needs attention". A
      document with nothing wrong shows no heading and no cards — just the grey
      fact line. Each card is a real button: the whole card highlights on hover,
      shows a pointer, and Tab reaches it
- [ ] The grey fact line reads as short noun phrases joined by "·" — frames,
      size, "5 of 10 images downscaled", "4 fonts embedded" — and never claims
      readiness
- [ ] Pages to export: up to four square thumbnails, each fitted inside its box
      (a portrait page leaves side margins). Every box fills — none stays empty
- [ ] Target on an image-heavy deck (the 31-slide Playground, 9.5 MB) lands
      within about 1.5 MB under the target, never over it, and Result says
      "Fits 9.5MB. This is the best quality that stays under it"; a text-only
      document with a generous target keeps Balanced ("Already under…")
- [ ] Target: typing "0.8" works, an emptied field falls back to the previous
      value (never silently 0.5), and −/+ step by 1 MB (0.5 ↔ 1 at the bottom).
      Image size and quality are locked in the Images tab with a line saying why
- [ ] Target with a large transparent PNG and an intentionally unreachable limit
      keeps every image visible, reports that the target was missed, and never
      downloads a suspiciously tiny blank PDF. `pdfimages -list` shows the image
      objects and alpha masks
- [ ] If Figma omits all processed images from a measured PDF, the plugin retries
      once after a short renderer delay. A second omission shows an error and does
      not open a save dialog
- [ ] Selecting 30 frames shows the list at once and the canvas keeps
      responding while the counts fill in; thumbnails arrive in batches rather
      than all at the end; clicking around inside the same frames (or inside a
      slide in Slides) does not re-run the scan or reset a custom order
- [ ] Selecting a section lists the frames inside it, not the section itself
- [ ] Figma Slides: with nothing selected the whole deck is listed in grid
      order and the rows say "slides"; selecting a slide row lists its slides;
      the exported PDF embeds real fonts (`pdffonts` shows CIDFontType2, no
      Type 3) and no temporary slide flashes or is left behind
- [ ] Order: sort by Canvas position / Name / Layer order, with a separate
      button to reverse. **Layer order matches Figma's layers panel top to
      bottom** — the list is not upside down. Reordering by hand shows a
      "Custom" chip with an undo
- [ ] Order rows: each row is a box — grip, number, thumbnail, name, meta, ✕.
      The grip shows a grab cursor and moves the row with ↑↓ from the keyboard;
      a long frame name ends in "…" and never overflows or clips its descenders;
      clicking a row reveals that frame on the canvas (selection unchanged);
      ✕ excludes and the excluded list restores individually
- [ ] Images opens on the same four presets as Start, as one row of chips. When
      the values match no preset a fifth **Custom** chip lights up instead of
      leaving every chip dark; the row keeps its height either way
- [ ] Under **Advanced** sit three bars — Largest (px) · Smallest (px) · Scale
      (×) — each showing its own value and the ends of its own ladder. Folded,
      the header still reads all three. A line says what the scale means
      ("Stays sharp zoomed to 150%, or 108 DPI in print.")
- [ ] Every bar responds across its whole range. Dragging Largest below Smallest
      is impossible — the ladder itself is trimmed, and the other bar never
      moves on its own. A stored pair that crosses (an old install with 1600
      min and 1280 max) is unfolded on load, not carried in
- [ ] Above the bars, four of this document's images are drawn to their real
      aspect: dashed = the size now, filled = the size exported, hatched = left
      alone. The line-up does **not** change when the bars move or while sizes
      are still loading — only the boxes do
- [ ] A selection with no images shows no diagram box at all; one whose sizes
      are still being read keeps the box at its full height and says so
- [ ] Images lists this document's images — name, the size it starts at, the
      size it ends up — and moving a bar moves the whole column. Clicking a row
      reveals those layers on the canvas. An image the Largest cap decides (not
      the scale) is called out, and the warning names the bar to raise
- [ ] Picking Target size here shows the MB field right below the chips — no
      trip back to Start to set the number
- [ ] Options: hyperlinks and fallback characters as plain toggles; "Export all
      text as outlines" sits apart under "Use with care", is **off** by default,
      and turning it on says the Fonts tab no longer applies — Start then shows
      that as its only card, pointing at Options
- [ ] Result before an export says nothing has been exported yet and what will
      appear; after one it opens automatically
- [ ] Result: a file card with the finished PDF's first page as a 1:1
      thumbnail, its name, size, pages and seconds. Text and Images are
      accordions — the head carries the summary, right-aligned in both — and
      open by default only when something in them needs attention
- [ ] Result reasons are noun phrases, not sentences ("Font file required: Nexa
      Heavy", not "A font file is required for…"), each a row with a count and a
      chevron; clicking one selects those layers on canvas.
      Image warnings live under Images, not under Text
- [ ] A document with no text shows no Text section at all, and one with no
      images shows no Images section
- [ ] Result shows the first lines of the embedded text with "See all" — and
      **See all actually opens the subpage**, where the text can be selected and
      copied
- [ ] Fonts: families are boxed rows — name, then the state right next to it,
      styles as badges below, a chevron on the right. The whole box is the hit
      area; a family with a problem has an amber border. Opening one shows a
      card per style with how much it is used, what is wrong and what happens if
      it is left
- [ ] Fonts: "Choose font folder…" reads .ttf/.otf/.ttc and adds the matching
      ones; the scan result box stays until closed or the next scan and says per
      font what was found and why it was not added. Expanding "Why is a font
      file required?" pushes the explanation **below** the row — it must not
      squeeze the folder button
- [ ] Font storage: reachable any time from the Fonts tab. Lists every stored
      font (including ones added in another file) with file name, size and
      whether this document uses it, right-aligned next to the trash button.
      "Delete all" asks once before emptying, and the meter frees at once
- [ ] A font file added by an old version that today's screen would refuse (a
      variable .ttf, or a file whose weight differs from its slot) is flagged on
      open: Start shows a card, and the style's card on the Fonts detail page
      says why; replacing the file clears both
- [ ] Latin headings match Figma's width (pair kerning): "Forward Deployed"
      in a kerned font is not wider than the native export
- [ ] A layer with a stylistic set on (e.g. SUIT ss18 arrow) exports that
      alternate glyph; a layer with Kerning turned off in Figma exports unkerned
- [ ] A layer mixing two fonts (an arrow in another font) draws each run in its
      own font
- [ ] Korean body text with word joiners (U+2060) exports as real text, and a
      line's last word lands where Figma put it (letter-spacing counts joiners)
- [ ] A layer containing an em dash or thin space the font lacks stays real
      text — only that character comes from Inter (Pretendard if it is CJK);
      Result says "3 characters missing from the font (…): drawn with Inter";
      turning off "Draw missing characters with a fallback font" in Options
      makes that layer outlined again, and Start warns before export
- [ ] A heading inside a component instance with vertical auto layout (hug)
      and a divider below it exports with the divider still below the heading,
      not on top of it; same for a text inside a group inside an auto-layout
      column
- [ ] Hyperlinks: a text layer with a URL link on part of its text exports as a
      clickable area over exactly those characters (Preview: hover shows the
      URL); "Keep hyperlinks" off in Options removes them; it is greyed out
      when "Export all text as outlines" is on
- [ ] An .otf (CFF) font file is accepted by the folder picker and by a per-style
      pick, `pdffonts` shows it as "CID Type 0C" with no "Mismatch" warning from
      `pdftotext`, and the text is selectable
- [ ] Empty state: Start asks for a selection, the promise line is shown, no
      "(0 pages)" in the button
- [ ] Every control that does something shows a pointer cursor — preset tiles,
      status cards, font rows, reason rows, links, and the library buttons
      ("Delete saved copy", "Select a different file…"). Nothing that does
      nothing shows one
- [ ] Nothing is clipped — Hangul ascenders/descenders and Latin g/j/y tails;
      English detail lines wrap instead of being cut; long names end in "…"

## Language & platform

- [ ] Figma app language Korean → Korean UI; English → English UI
- [ ] On Windows: font paths show `C:\Windows\Fonts` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\...`,
      and the guidance mentions the file name field (**no ⌘⇧G**)
- [ ] On macOS: `~/Library/Fonts` and `/Library/Fonts`, guidance mentions ⌘⇧G
- [ ] Figma in the browser: export and download still work

`npm run ui:preview` renders most of these without Figma:
`?screen=fonts&theme=dark&lang=en-US&platform=win&frames=12&bare=1`
(`screen` = `settings` / `frames` / `fonts` / `text` / `preview`; `text=clean`
for a document with nothing to outline; `report=1` for the result card).

## Export behaviour

- [ ] Button shows the right page count; progress reads like
      "Page 3/8 · optimizing images 1/4"
- [ ] The save dialog is pre-filled with `name_20260826134512.pdf`
      (single frame → frame name, multiple → document name)
- [ ] A canvas toast confirms the save; the report's first line has file name,
      pages, size and elapsed time

## Text embedding

- [ ] A single text node mixing Regular and Bold → only the bold part is bold in
      the PDF, and `pdffonts` lists both weights as embedded subsets
- [ ] `pdftotext` output matches the Figma text, Hangul included
- [ ] Underlined text keeps its underline (stays as outlines), and the report
      says why
- [ ] A layer with superscript/subscript text (e.g. "1st, 2nd" with Position:
      Superscript) stays as outlines and looks exactly as in Figma; the
      pre-flight Text row and the report both say "superscript/subscript"
- [ ] A bulleted or numbered list exports as real text with the marker where
      Figma drew it (`pdftotext` shows the bullet or number); a right-to-left
      list stays outlined with that reason
- [ ] Text used as a mask, text with Multiply blend, text inside a 50% opacity
      group, and text overflowing a clipping frame all stay as outlines with
      their own reason; text inside a card with a filled drop shadow is still
      embedded
- [ ] A 60% opacity text layer is embedded and the PDF shows it at 60%
- [ ] Inter body text: a line of "1111111111" in Inter Regular 40pt has the same
      width in the PDF as in Figma's own PDF export (`pdftotext -bbox`), and an
      Inter Semi Bold layer is embedded (`pdffonts` shows Inter-SemiBold as
      CID Type 0C), not outlined
- [ ] Baseline snap: in the exported PDF's content stream every `Tm` y of our
      text equals Figma's own PDF export for the same layer (integer baselines,
      e.g. 376 not 376.45) and `npm run compare` reports no vertical shift
- [ ] Fonts screen: Inter shows "v3.19 · the build Figma bundles", Pretendard
      shows its version, and an uploaded file shows "file vX.Y" read from the
      font; stored fonts list the version too
- [ ] Font build check: with a font Figma renders in one build and a *different*
      build uploaded for a family that is not in the catalog (e.g. upload an
      older/newer version of a custom font), the export keeps that font's text
      as outlines and the report says "letter widths differ from Figma by N%";
      a full Pretendard/Inter resume produces no such reason (no false alarms)
- [ ] A link on part of a line whose text mixes a fallback glyph (e.g. "—") has
      its link rectangle exactly under the linked words
- [ ] Cancelling at any point (page loop, Fit-to-Size probing, final pass) saves
      nothing, shows a "Cancelled" toast and returns the panel to idle at once;
      clicking Export again right away runs a fresh export after the previous
      one finishes cleaning up, with no leftover clone on the canvas
- [ ] The result card says the target was missed if the file is bigger than the
      Fit-to-Size target
- [ ] With Wi-Fi turned off after the pre-flight check passed, an export whose
      catalog font can't be fetched at draw time ends with "could not be drawn"
      and saves nothing, instead of a PDF with missing text
- [ ] Clicking a reason in the report selects those layers on the canvas
- [ ] With frames selected, editing a text (characters, font, size) or swapping
      an image inside one of them refreshes the pre-flight rows within a second
      while a manual order and exclusions in the Pages screen are kept

## Fonts & fallback

- [ ] A catalog font (e.g. Nanum Gothic) is embedded with no upload needed
- [ ] A catalog font whose style Figma spells differently ("Semi Bold" vs
      "SemiBold", "Regular Italic" vs "Italic", a "… Variable" family) still
      shows as "auto-downloaded"
- [ ] macOS: "Find in a font folder…" on /System/Library/Fonts adds Helvetica
      Neue and Apple SD Gothic Neo from their .ttc collections, and the stored
      entry says "HelveticaNeue.ttc (Bold)"; exporting embeds them (`pdffonts`
      shows Helvetica Neue as CID TrueType, Apple SD Gothic Neo as CID Type 0C)
- [ ] Uploading a .ttc to a slot it doesn't contain (e.g. Helvetica.ttc for
      "Helvetica Neue Bold") says which faces the collection has
- [ ] A Google Fonts download folder holding both the variable file and a
      `static` folder: the scan adds the static weights (not the variable file),
      and a folder with only the variable file reports "only as variable files"
- [ ] An optical-size family whose static files are all suffixed (Inter,
      Merriweather, Newsreader, Fraunces, Bodoni Moda — "Inter 18pt" in the
      name table) is found under the family name Figma shows; with the text at
      14 px the 18pt file is picked, at 40 px the 28pt file
- [ ] "Open Sans" / "Condensed Bold" (variable Open Sans installed) gets
      `OpenSans_Condensed-Bold.ttf`, not the normal-width Bold; with no
      Condensed file in the folder the font is reported as weight missing
- [ ] The scan summary counts what happened per font: added, several matching
      files (newest used), could not be saved (with the reason), weight missing,
      variable only, unusable, not in this folder; with an unreadable file in
      the folder the wording changes to "not found (scan incomplete)"
- [ ] "Added N" only counts fonts the plugin confirmed saving; fill the storage
      close to 5 MB first and the summary reports the failed saves
- [ ] After a folder scan the result stays on the Fonts screen (a two-line box:
      "Folder scan: 3 added · 4 out of room · 1 not found", then "X needed,
      Y free" with "Retry N") until it is closed or the next scan starts — also
      after switching screens and back; no toast is involved
- [ ] Each font row is two lines and the second says what the scan found:
      "no room · size · file" with a Retry button in place of Add; "not in that
      folder"; "family in the folder, not this weight"; "only a variable file —
      use its static folder"; "not found — scan incomplete". Never a bare "no
      file" for a font the scan found; no text-node counts, no paragraphs
      between the rows, and a long file name never hides the reason
- [ ] With the storage nearly full: scan, delete a stored font, press Retry on
      the row (or "Retry N" in the box) — the font is saved without picking the
      folder again and the row switches to the file; a font larger than 5 MB
      says so instead of offering Retry
- [ ] Storage use ("storage X of 5.0MB" and the bar) shows at the top of the
      Fonts screen; the folder button reads "Choose font folder…" and the line
      under it says the greyed-out files are normal
- [ ] Nothing stored is deleted automatically when a scan runs out of room —
      deleting is always the user's click under "Stored fonts"
- [ ] macOS: Helvetica Neue "Medium Italic" and "Thin Italic" from the .ttc are
      stored without a "will export as Medium weight" warning (their italic
      bits are unset in the file; the name decides)
- [ ] Embedding flag: a font whose OS/2 fsType is Restricted only is refused by
      Add ("license flag forbids embedding") and by the folder scan (row says
      "the folder's file forbids embedding"); Futura Medium (Restricted +
      Preview & Print) and DIN Alternate (Preview & Print) are accepted;
      Helvetica Neue (Installable) and Apple SD Gothic Neo (Editable) too
- [ ] A restricted font stored by an older version is re-read on open, flagged
      on the Fonts screen and in the pre-flight, and its text stays as outlines
      at export with the reason in the report — the export finishes and the PDF
      is written; it never stops with "text would be lost"
- [ ] Retry can't be double-counted: click Retry twice quickly (or Retry N while
      a row retry is running) and the added count rises by one per font; a retry
      answered after a new folder scan starts does not touch the new result
- [ ] Opening a file whose stored font has no version or embedding data does not
      loop: the Fonts screen settles and the font list is not rewritten
      repeatedly (watch the console/Network idle after the panel loads)
- [ ] A font file whose glyph table is broken is skipped as one candidate: the
      scan reads the rest of the folder, counts it under "scan incomplete", and
      if the scan does stop, the result box says why and keeps what was added
- [ ] Memory: scanning /System/Library/Fonts (370 files, 778 MB) with a font that
      is not there finishes in about a second and the plugin stays responsive.
      Node measurement 2026-09-08: reading every file gave peak RSS 1 GB from
      file buffers awaiting GC (heap 21 MB, retained faces 3 MB); with files
      over 32 MB whose names don't match skipped (4 of 370, reported as not
      checked) the peak is 400 MB in 0.6 s. The 64 MB cap is on retained faces,
      not on the peak
- [ ] A font outside the catalog shows "Font file required" and stays as
      outlines — the Start row warns with the font's name and "Fonts ›" opens
      the Fonts screen
- [ ] Offline (Wi-Fi off): catalog fonts fall back to outlines and the PDF still
      exports cleanly

## Images

- [ ] A logo well within the frame's budget comes out untouched —
      `pdfimages -list` shows the original dimensions and encoding
- [ ] An oversized screenshot is downscaled; no image exceeds its target
- [ ] Transparent PNGs stay PNG (no black boxes)
- [ ] Options → "Trim pictures to the visible area" is on by default. With a
      document whose fills are cropped, the exported PDF carries piece-sized
      images (`pdfimages -list`), they sit where Figma draws them, and the same
      export with the toggle off is larger
- [ ] The Images tab status line reads "Trim pictures to the visible area: on ·
      applies to N partly visible images" (off → "… are stored in full"), and
      "Options ›" opens the Options tab
- [ ] The Images list columns are Visible area · Original · Stored · Trimmed; a
      trimmed row's Stored is the piece size, and a row clipped by its frame
      shows "none" under Trimmed with the note below the list
- [ ] The result card counts trimmed images, and any that fell back say they
      were downscaled in full instead
- [ ] A rotated CROP fill, a FILL at 90°, and a photo with EXIF orientation 6
      all come out in the same place as Figma draws them
- [ ] A cropped or aspect-mismatched fill keeps the density its visible part
      needs — `pdfimages -list` x-ppi for it is no lower than for a plainly
      placed image at the same scale
- [ ] At 2× on an image-heavy deck the file is smaller than the same export
      from the previous release, and the text is byte-identical (same word
      count from `pdftotext`, same font object count from `pdffonts`)
- [ ] At 1× the file is no larger than the previous release's 1× — the Balanced
      preset's floor is 640, and a floor above that silently overrides the scale
      bar for anything placed small

## Fit to Size

Exports a baseline pass, then patches verified image streams directly. Unsupported structures fall
back to the full chosen pass, with up to two retries if the finished file is over target. Budget time.
Watch the progress bar — it must fill in one direction only, never restart at a later pass.

- [ ] A target well above the document's size finishes in one pass and reports
      "already under" — the file is byte-identical to the same export with the
      Balanced preset
- [ ] A reachable target lands **under** it — check `pdfinfo` against the number
      you typed, not just the report line
- [ ] An impossible target (say 0.5MB on an image-heavy deck) reports the floor
      in the warning colour, and the file it produced matches that floor
- [ ] A text-only document with a target below its size reports unreachable
      without burning a second pass
- [ ] Cancelling mid-search still leaves a usable PDF and no `__sheaf_tmp__`
      layers
- [ ] The saved file's size (`pdfinfo`) equals the number on the result card —
      the measured merge is what gets saved, not a fresh one
- [ ] The result card carries one settings line under the verdict: "Auto: scale
      2× · max 4096px · JPEG 92%" (plus "· PNG kept" on the top rung), and no
      prediction or candidate numbers — those live in the plugin console
- [ ] A target the first candidate misses shows "The file came out over the
      target. Re-exporting with the next candidate (1/2)" and saves the retry
- [ ] A mixed JPEG/transparent-PNG document whose partial direct result is over target falls back to
      a full Figma pass and can still reach a target that requires shrinking the PNG
- [ ] An image exported with an unverified RGB ICC profile falls back to the full Figma pass; colours
      match Figma's own export
- [ ] When nothing fits, the card says "could not meet …" with the number of
      re-exports, and the file is still saved
- [ ] Cancelling during a retry pass saves nothing and leaves no `__sheaf_tmp__`

## Document safety

- [ ] After exporting, the Figma document is unchanged (text fills intact)
- [ ] No `__sheaf_tmp__` layers left behind, including after a cancel or an error
- [ ] Cancelling mid-export leaves the document clean

## Inspecting the result

```bash
pdfinfo out.pdf                 # size, pages, producer
pdffonts out.pdf                # embedded subsets (emb=yes, uni=yes)
pdftotext out.pdf - | head -40  # extracted text
pdfimages -list out.pdf         # per-image dimensions and encoding
```

## Extracted text (ATS)

The whole point of embedding real fonts is that a parser reads them. Check the
text, not just the picture — a leftover outline is invisible on screen and only
shows up in extraction.

```bash
pdftotext out.pdf - | head -40    # is every paragraph there exactly once?
pdffonts out.pdf                  # Type 3 count should match the outline count
```

- [ ] No paragraph appears twice — once garbled, once whole. That means glyphs
      were hidden but not removed, and a parser reads both
- [ ] The name/heading line is intact (not "장장원석A AI")
- [ ] "Check what a parser reads" in the report matches what `pdftotext` prints
- [ ] With every font embedded, `pdffonts` shows no Type 3 at all
